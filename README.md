## **Overview**  
MedBlock is a **privacy-preserving, decentralized medical record management system** built using **ZkVerify proofs**. It ensures that **medical records remain tamper-proof and verifiable** without exposing sensitive patient data.

## **Why ZkVerify?**  
-> Ensures **authenticity** of medical records without exposing patient details  
-> Prevents **tampering and fraud**, ensuring data integrity  
-> Eliminates the need to carry physical medical records  
-> Enables **AI-driven research** while preserving patient privacy  
-> Helps **insurance companies** verify legitimate claims
